# JS Exercises with Programming Logic: Registration and Artist Search

A concert hall needs to register all the artists that play there. It is very important to keep 3 pieces of information about them:

-   Name
-   Music style
-   Days of the week with availability

The challenge is to use Javascript to create a function called **registerArtist**, which receives 3 parameters: name (string), MusicalStyle (string), daysAvailables (array) and adds this new artist to a global variable called _Artistslist_.

## Artists available

We have an array called _Artistslist_ that stores some information such as Name, Music Style and Days of the week with availability. Your challenge is to create a function called **ArtistsAvailable(dayWeek)** that receives the parameter dayWeek and prints the artists available on that day.
